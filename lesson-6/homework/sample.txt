A mass of 1 slug, when attached to a spring, stretches it 2 feet
and then comes to rest in the equilibrium  position. Starting at
t 5 0, an external force equal to f (t) 5 8 sin 4t is applied to the
system. Find the equation of motion if the surrounding medium
offers a damping force that is numerically equal to 8 times the
instantaneous velocity.
